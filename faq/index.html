					On some devices/Android versions this more prominent. To help reduce this you can try some or all of the below:

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Unfortunately this can be phone/Android version specific. Make sure your phone is not too aggressive in force closing apps/services to preserve memory or battery. You will have to check your phone settings for this and may need to search online to find a solution that works for your phone.
					Another possible culprit can be “Memory” cleaner apps (such as Clean Master) which will automatically force kill services such as this one. You will have to find a setting to make Fake GPS JoyStick an exception or disable the app when using Fake GPS JoyStick.
					Also on some Android devices you can have a maximum of 3 foreground type services at any given time. Make sure you do not have other services running that would cause Fake GPS JoyStick service to force close.</p>
